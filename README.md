# Dijkstra Algorithm

This code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in undirected graphs. It uses namedtuples for graph structure, defaultdict for efficient representation, and heapq for optimal path selection. The implementation includes graph creation from edge lists and the main algorithm function. A sample 4-node graph demonstrates the code's functionality, printing shortest distances from a start node to all others.


## Prerequisites

To use this Dijkstra's algorithm implementation:

Ensure Python is installed on your system
Clone the GitHub repository
Run the script - no additional setup or libraries needed

Python's standard library provides all required modules.
